BGP Router is a hardware box with bunch of high speed jacks on it (ports). Each port has diff ip 

The routers job is to 
(1) keep its forwarding table up-to-date, based on the BGP protocol messages it gets from its neighbors, 
(2) help keep its neighbors' forwarding tables up to date, by sending BGP protocol messages to them, and 
(3) make a best-effort attempt to forward data packets to their correct destination.



Provided is a simple implementation of a router that simply connects to its peers, sends a handshake message, and prints out every other message it receives. 



/config holds the tests they’ll run on us, using ./run script

COMMAND LINE SPEC
$ ./run [config-file]



./3700router is the router script we write:
When executed, it will
1. Open several UDP sockets, each corr to one “port” on router
    1. Yes, multiple open sockets at once
2. Receive msgs on these sockets (ports), each being
    1. BGP command from a neighbor, or
    2. A data packet u have to forward to dest

"The simulator will take care of setting up the UDP sockets, running your program, and closing your program at the end of each simulation.”

Instead of real packet formats, well send json 

Requirements:
1. Accept route updates from bgp neighbors
    1. Forward them as appropriate
2. Accept route revocation (?) msgs from bgp neighbors
    1. Forward as appropriate
3. Forward data packets correctly
4. Return error msgs when packet cant be delivered
5. **** Coalesce forwarding table entries from networks that are adjacent and on same port 
6. **** Serialize your routing table cache so it can be checked for correctness 


Command Line Spec for our script
                <portNum-IPwithdotsInIt-peer|prov|cust>
./router <asn> <port-ip.add.re.ss-[peer,prov,cust]> [port-ip.add.re.ss-[peer,prov,cust]] ...[port-ip.add.re.ss-[peer,prov,cust]]


takes one argument: the AS number for your router

then 1 or more arguments representing the “ports” that connect to its neighboring routers. 
For each port, the respective command line argument informs your router 
  (1) what UDP port you should use to communicate with the neighboring router, 
  (2) what IP address of the neighboring router on this port, and 
  (3) the type of relationship your router has with this neighboring router: peer, provider, or customer


eg --> ./router 7 7833-1.2.3.2-cust 2374-192.168.0.2-peer 1293-67.32.9.2-prov
  This tells us your router:

  - is part of AS 7.
  - has three ports, connected to three neighboring routers. 
      - will need to open three UDP sockets to ports 7833, 2374, and 1293, respectively. (the sim does this tho??)
  - IP of neighbor router on the first port is 1.2.3.2 --> the IP your router should use on this port is 1.2.3.1 (NEIGHBOR ALWAYS ENDS IN 2, URS ENDS IN 1)
  - The first neighbor belongs to a BGP customer. The second neighbor is a BGP peer. The third neighbor is a BGP provider.
